
OpenCV provides several built-in trackers other than the Go Turn tracker (cv2.TrackerGOTURN_create()) that you can use in place of it. Some of the commonly used trackers in OpenCV include:

Boosting Tracker (cv2.TrackerBoosting_create())
MIL Tracker (cv2.TrackerMIL_create())
KCF Tracker (cv2.TrackerKCF_create())
TLD Tracker (cv2.TrackerTLD_create())
MedianFlow Tracker (cv2.TrackerMedianFlow_create())
MOSSE Tracker (cv2.TrackerMOSSE_create())
CSRT Tracker (cv2.TrackerCSRT_create())
You can replace cv2.TrackerGOTURN_create() with any of the above tracker creation functions to use a different tracker
